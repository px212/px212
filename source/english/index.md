Welcome! Thanks for visiting my homepage. I am an Associate Professor in meteorology at [Institute of Atmospheric Physics](http://english.iap.cas.cn/) (IAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). By using observations, idealized models and outputs from the GCMs, I hope to improve our understanding of key controls on the large-scale circulation (e.g., jet streams, storm tracks and planetary waves) in the middle latitudes, and how this may change in the future. You are weclome to visit my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peiqiang_Xu), [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p66mFW4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/peiqiang_xu) webpages. I am also very fond of doing geophysical fluid experiments, you can find the details of our lab [here](http://www.njugfd.org/home.html).

In addition, I am an Associate Editor of the [Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1477870X).

Climate Friends has routine activities (both off-line and on-line) at every Thursday evening (Beijing Time). Please feel free to contact me if you want more information!
